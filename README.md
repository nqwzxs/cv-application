# CV Application

CV Application is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) written on React using props, hooks like useState, useRef, and using react-to-print.

In CV Application, you can create a simple resume consisting of sections like personal information, education and professional experience. Upon starting the app, there is an example resume data that you can easily remove by pressing on "Clear" button on toolbar. Also, thanks to react-to-print, you can print the resume by pressing on "Print" button on toolbar.
